Database and Online Statistics for 1979
.A
Williams M.E.
.W
    The number of databases, records contained in databases and the online
use of databases has increased dramatically over the past several years,
bringing the 1979 totals for bibliographic, bioliographic-related, and
natural language databases to 528.  These 528 databases contain 148 million
records.  Some 4 million online searches were conducted via the major U.S.
and Canadian systems in 1979.

The Relational Model in Information Retrieval
.A
Crawford, R.G.
.W
    The relational model has received increasing attention during the
past decade.  Its advantages include simplicity, consistency, and a sound
theoretical basis.  In this article, the naturalness of viewing information
retrieval relationally is demonstrated.  The relational model is presented,
and the relational organization of a bibliographical database is shown.
The notion of normalization is introduced and first, second, third, and
fourth normal forms are demonstrated.  Relational languages are discussed,
including the relational calculus, relational algebra, and SEQUEL.
Numerous examples pertinent to information retrieval are presented in these
relational languages.  Advantages of the relational approach to information
retrieval are noted.

A Model of Cluster Searching Based on Classification
.A
Croft, W.B.
.W
    The use of document clusters has been suggested as an efficient file
organization for a document retrieval system.  It is possible that by
using this information about the relationships between documents that the
effectiveness of the system (i.e., its ability to distinguish relevant
from non-relevant documents) may also be improved.  In this paper a
probabilistic model of cluster searching  based on query classification is
described.  This model is tested with retrieval experiments which indicate
that it can be more effective than heuristic cluster searches and cluster
searches based on other models.  It can also be more effective than a full
search in which every document is compared to the query.  The efficiency
aspects of the implementation of the model are discussed.

Fuzzy Requests:  An Approach to Weighted Boolean Searches
.A
Bookstein, A.
.W
    This article concerns the problem of how to permit a patron to
represent the relative importance of various index terms in a Boolean
request while retaining the desirable properties of a Boolean system.
The character of classical Boolean systems is reviewed and related to the
notion of fuzzy sets.  The fuzzy set concept then forms the basis of the
concept of a fuzzy request in which weights are assigned to index terms.
Ther properties of such a system are discussed, and it is shown that such
systems retain the manipulability of traditional Boolean requests.

Searching Biases in Large Interactive Document Retrieval Systems
.A
Blair, D.C.
.W
    The way that individuals construct and modify search queries on a
large interactive document retrieval system is subject to systematic biases
similar to those that have been demonstrated in experiments on judgements
under uncertainty.  These biases are shared by both naive and sophisticated
subjects and cause the inquirer searching for documents on a large interactive
system to construct and modify queries inefficiently.  A searching algorithm
is suggested that helps the inquirer to avoid the effect of these biases.

A Comparison of Two Systems of Weighted Boolean Retrieval
.A
Bookstein, A.
.W
    A major deficiency of traditional Boolean systems is their inability to
represent the varying degrees to which a document may be written on a subject.
In this article we isolate a number of criteria that should be met by any
Boolean system generalized to have a weighting capability.  It is proven that
only one weighting rule satisfies these conditions--that associated with fuzzy-
set theory--and that this weighting scheme satisfies most of the other
properties associated with Boolean algebra as well.  Probabilistic weighting
is then introduced as an alternative approach and the two systems compared.
In the limit of zero/one weights, all systems considered converge to
traditional Boolean retrieval.

Parallel Computations in Information Retrieval
.A
Salton, G.
Bergmark, D.
.W
    Conventional information retrieval processes are largely based on data
movement, pointer manipulations and integer arithmetic; more refined retrieval
algorithms may in addition benefit from substantial computational power.

    In the present study a number of parallel processing methods are described
that serve to enhance retrieval services.  In conventional retrieval
environments parallel list processing and parallel search facilities are of
greatest interest.  In more advanced systems, the use of array processors
also proves beneficial.  Various information retrieval processes are examined
and evidence is given to demonstrate the usefulness of parallel processing
and fast computational facilities in information retrieval.

Performance Testing of a Book and Its Index as a Information Retrieval
System
.A
Bennion, B.C.
.W
    The retrieval performance of book indexes can be measured in terms of
their ability to direct a user selectively to text material whose identity
but not location is known.  The method requires human searchers to base
their searching strategies on actual passages from the book rather than on
test queries, natural or contrived.  It circumvents the need for relevance
judgement, but still yields performance indicators that correspond
approximately to the recall and precision ratios of large document retrieval
system evaluation.  A preliminary application of the method to the subject
indexing of two major encyclopedias showed one encyclopedia apparently
superior in both the finding and discrimination abilities of retrieval
performance.  The method is presently best suited for comparative testing
since its ability to yield absolute or reproducible measures is as yet not
established.

van Rijsbergen, C.J.
Harper, D.J.
Porter, M.F.

    This paper tackles the problem of how one might select further search terms,
using relevance feedback, given the search terms in the query.  These search
terms are extracted from a maximum spanning tree connecting all the terms in the
index term vocabulary.  A number of different spanning trees are generated from
a variety of association measures.  The retrieval effectiveness for the
different spanning trees is shown to be approximately the same.  Effectiveness
is measured in terms of precision and recall, and the retrieval tests are done
on three different test collections.

The Combined Use of Bibliographic Coupling and Cocitation for Document
Retrieval
.A
Bichteler, J.
Eaton, E.A. III
.W
    A linkage similarity measure which takes into account both the bibliographic
coupling of documents and their cocitations (both cited and citing papers)
produced improved document retrieval over a measure based only on
bibliographic coupling.  The test collection consisted of 1712 papers whose
relevance to specific queries had been judged by users.  To evaluate the
effect of using cocitation data, we calculated for each query two measures
of similarity between each relevant paper and every other paper retrieved.
Papers were then sorted by the similarity measures, producing two ordered
lists.  We then compared the resulting predictions of relevance, partial
relevance, and non-relevance to the user's evaluations of the same papers.
Overall, the change from the bibliographic coupling measure to the linkage
similarity measure, representing the introduction of cocitation data,
resulted in better retrieval performance.

Feature Comparison of an In-House Information Retrieval System With a
Commercial Search Service
.A
Boyle, S.O.
Miller, A.P.
.W
    A commercially available online search was used as a standard for
comparative searching and evaluation of an in-house information system
based on automatic indexing.  System features were identified and
evaluated on the basis of their usefulness in various kinds of searching,
their ease in implementation, and how they are influenced by differences
in user type or specific applications.  Some common features of the
commercial system, such as online instruction, user-specified print formats,
dictionary display, and truncation, are seen to be unnecessary or
impractical for the in-house system.  In designing the in-house system,
therefore, detald consideration must be given to the applications,
operating environment, and real user needs.  While a commercial system can
serve as a useful standard for comparative evaluation, one must be
careful not to attempt to duplicate it blindly in-house.

The Application of a Minicomputer to Thesaurus Construction

    The Use of a minicomputer in various phases of creating the thesaurus
for the National Information Center for Special Education Materials
(NICSEM) database is described.  The minicomputer is used to collect,
edit, and correct candidate thesaurus terms.  The use of the minicomputer
eases the process of grouping terms into files of similar concepts and
facilitates the generation of products useful in vocabulary review and in
term structuring.  Syndetic relations, indicated by assigning coded
identification numbers, are altered easily in the design phase to reflect
restructuring requirements.  Because thesaurus terms are already in machine-
readable form, it is simple to prepare print programs to provide permuted,
alphabetic, hierarchical, and chart formatted term displays.  Overall, the
use of the minicomputer facilitates initial thesaurus entry development by
reducing clerical effort, editorial staff decisions, and overall processing
times.

document collection.  The complexity and running time of the algorithm are
